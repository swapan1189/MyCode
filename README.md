# MyCode
Some examples of codes and exercises I have performed.

Over the past 7 years of my work-experience, I have worked in few different languages and many different tools.
I am relatively new to github and the goal is to maintain the code that I create. I am a Data Science Enthusiast and I do deal with Python (for learning) and SQL (work and learning) among other.
